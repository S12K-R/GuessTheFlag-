# GuessTheFlag-
Guest the flag game using SwiftUI

This is a simple guessing game where three different flags are shown to the player, along with a label asking for the correct flag to be picked. The game
randomizes countries from an array, then shows their respective flags taking their picture from the app assets, after guessing correctly (or wrong), 
the counter at the bottom of the screen may add up or not depending on the answer. The game stops after eight tries with an alert showing user score then
restarting the game.

The app features a more complex UI than the Tip Splitter, making use of gradients, Zstacks  and rounded corners to create a more sofisticated design.
